Package: R2llvm
Title: LLVM-based compiler for R code
Version: 0.1-0
Description: A prototype for a compiler for R code that uses LLVM to generate machine code.
 This is a fork of the RLLVMCompile package. We are using the type information from the
 package RTypeInference and also the Control Flow Graph from the rstatic package
 both primarily by Nick Ulle.
