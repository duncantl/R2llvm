<abstract>

<para>
We describe some experiments and an approach to compiling
R code to native machine instructions.
The primary goal is to make R code execute significantly
faster, e.g. by a factor of 100 or 500 or more.

An important part of our approach is exploiting information
about the type of R objects. We rely on the caller providing 
this information at present.

<title>Background</title>
<para>
It is clear that using high-level programming languages such as R,
MATLAB, Python and Perl lead to improved productivity and use of human
time.  However, these interpreted languages often lead to code that is
considerably slower than compiled languages such as C++, C, FORTRAN,
Java, etc.  This trade-off between development and maintenance time
and compute time is one that everyone would like to remove by making
the high-level code run as fast as the low-level code.  This is very
challenging. However, we believe that there is a continuum between the
use of high-level languages and low-level languages. Specifically, as
we interactively develop code, we want the facilities of the
high-level language - namely no need for type declarations, the
disruptive compile-load-run cycle, etc.  But after we have finalized
our script or functions, we want the speed of low-level languages. We
are prepared to endure compilation times if the code will run
significantly faster. We further expect that many users of R would be
willing to provide additional information about their "final" code to
make it run ten or one hundred times faster.
Motivated by this expectation, we have developed a prototype system
for compiling R code to machine code that exploits the types of the
different R objects to attain significant speed-up in the execution of the code.
</para>
<para>
This paper describes our initial experiments with compiling R code to
machine instructions by leveraging a third party library - LLVM, the
Low-Level Virtual Machine.  LLVM is a C++ library that facilitates
creating intermediate representations of code and then optimizing that
code and generating machine-level instructions for many different
target platforms. In this respect, it is a general compiler
infrastructure that works on many platforms.  It is being used in many
different applications, including alternatives to the compilers gcc
and g++.  It is a robust, comprehensive compiler toolkit with a
dynamic developer and user community.  This is what makes it
attractive as we can passively leverage the ongoing improvements to
the code base without squandering resources within our own limited
community.  The optimization passes of the code this library presents,
and continues to provide, makes this a promising direction to which we
can connect compilation of R code.

<para>
A very important motivation to us  in this approach
is that we are building on work of a vibrant, reasonably 
large community, i.e. the LLVM developers and users, 
that will continue to maintain,  adapt and improve 
LLVM to future platforms and opportunities.
We can develop a compiler ourselves within the R
or statistics community, but we feel that there are too
few of us to maintain and develop this successfully in the future.
We applaud those who are doing this as it is a worthwhile endeavor.
</para>

<para>
We are making extensive use of information of the types of each variable.
At present, the caller is required to specify this information for every
variable.  We can make this system a great deal smarter and infer the types
of intermediate variables in many cases. We may even be able to infer the
types of <citation>DiamondRuby</citation>

<title>Future Directions</title>

<para>
We plan to make our compiler handle more R idioms
and language features.
</para>

<para>
We will provide interfaces to more of the LLVM C++ API from
within R.
</para>

<para>
We plan to analyze R functions and scripts
so that we can identify where copying 
R objects can be avoided, given that we are running
in a special "optimized" mode.
The CodeDepends package will help here in identifying
where variables are no longer used,
when they are redefined, etc.
