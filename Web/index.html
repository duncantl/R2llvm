<h1>The RLLVMCompile Package</h1>

The RLLVMCompile package is a functioning prototype of a customizable
and extensible compiler for simple R code and specific, but common, R
idioms.  The compiler functions are written entirely in R and use the
<a href="../Rllvm">Rllvm</a> package to generate the native code.
The result is code that is competitive with compiled C/C++ code,
but generated directly from R implementations.

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
The compiler is intentionally quite simple at present.
It takes an R function or collection of expressions and
translates the R calls to corresponding LLVM instructions.
For example,
<pre>
  x = exp( ((x - mu)/sigma)^2 )
</pre>
is recognized as an assignment call (=) with two elements - the left
hand side and the right hand side.
We compile the right-hand side, by traversing this sub-expression.
We recognize this as a call to exp() with one argument.
This one argument is an expression which is a call to ^ with two inputs:
<code>(x - mu)/sigma</code> and the literal value 2.
We compile the first of these expression, finally getting to binary
operators for / and -.
<p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
The compiler is written in R and we have made no effort
yet to make it fast. The resulting code however is fast,
competitive with C code. Results depend greatly on the particular
problem and implementation in R or C.
However, we do see significant improvements in performance
for common problems, ranging from
<ol>
  <li> making interpreted R code essentially equivalent in performance to R internal functions
         implemented in C,
  <li> 200 for a 2 dimensional random walk implemented in R,
  <li> a 50% speedup over heavily vectorized versions of the 2-D
      random walk
  <li> a factor of 600 for the naieve, simple Fibonacci sequence implementation,
  <li> a 20x speedup over reading data from a large file by changing
      the nature of the computations, but doing them all in R and compiling
  <li> 4 - 6x speedup over native C code in R for computing distances
      by avoiding redundant computations and memory consumption due to
      the rigid C code in R.
</ol>

<h2>Generating PTX Code</h2>

<p> Recently (July 2013), I added a customized version of the compiler
that compiles a variation of R code that targets GPUs.  We can compile
an R function as a GPU kernel.  The R code can refer to CUDA terms
such as threadIdx, blockIdx, blockDim and gridDim.  We access the x,
y, z components as if these were R lists, e.g.
<code>threadIdx$x</code> and <code>gridDim$x</code>.  We rewrite these
expressions to calls to access the corresponding registers.

<p>
When we have created the LLVM IR code for a routine, we don't
compile it to native code, but use the LLVM backend.
We can then load this code via the <a href="../RCUDA">RCUDA</a>
package and then  invoke it with the <code>.gpu()</code> function.


<p>
This is an example  of how we can easily customize the compiler
to handle non-standard R code in target-specific ways.

<p> We plan to improve the compiler and also add additional processing
steps that analyzes memory usage to avoid copies and also attempt to
reuse memory.  The <a href="../CodeDepends">CodeDepends</a> package is
a useful aid in this, allowing us to calculate data flow in a sequence
of R expressions.  We also plan to identify parallelism and map the
computations to GPUs or multiple CPUs.

<h2>Features and Issues</h2>
This does not handle all R code by any means.
It handles
<ul>
  <li> arithmetic (integer and floating point)
  <li> logical operations (&amp;&amp;, ||, negation)
  <li> element-wise integer index subsetting and assignment (adjusting to 0-based counting),      
  <li> if() statements,
  <li> for() and while() loops,
  <li> sapply() calls,
  <li> recursively compile functions that are called by other
      functions,
  <li> use and call native routines
  <li> work with some R objects in the compiled code
</ul>

It cannot handle calls to <code>eval()</code>
and will never be able to do this generally.
(It might be able to handle specific cases.)

<h3>Type Specification</h3>
The compiler needs the caller to provide type information for the
parameters and the return type. However, these can be determined dynamically given
sample R arguments the code will be called with.
We are also developing a type inference package.
